🧊 Mesh Voxelization Toolkit
A high-performance tool for converting watertight triangular meshes into signed distance fields (SDFs) or occupancy grids. Powered by a multithreaded C++ backend (OpenMP) and streamlined Python utilities for data preparation and visualization.

✨ Features
⚡ Fast & Multithreaded – High-speed C++ backend with OpenMP

🎯 Dual Output – Signed distance fields and occupancy volumes

🔧 Custom Sampling – Corner-based or center-based SDF sampling

🎨 Color-Preserving – Retains face colors in occupancy mode

📦 Compact Output – HDF5 .h5 format for all outputs

🚀 Quick Start
bash
Copy
Edit
# Build the core
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

# Voxelize to 32³ occupancy grid
../bin/voxelize occ ../examples/input ../examples/occ32.h5

# Voxelize to 64³ SDF volume (center sampling)
../bin/voxelize sdf --height 64 --width 64 --depth 64 --center \
                 ../examples/input ../examples/sdf64.h5
Visualize SDF volumes with marching cubes:

bash
Copy
Edit
python ../examples/marching_cubes.py ../examples/sdf64.h5 ../examples/mesh_out/
🔧 Installation
🛠️ C++ Core Requirements
Dependency	Purpose
CMake ≥ 3.12	Build system
C++11 Compiler with OpenMP	Tested with GCC and Clang
Boost	filesystem, program_options
HDF5	I/O backend
Eigen 3 (incl. unsupported/Tensor)	Tensor operations

Ubuntu install:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libboost-all-dev libhdf5-dev libeigen3-dev
Make sure your compiler supports -fopenmp.

🐍 Python Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy h5py scikit-image
# Or use PyMCubes instead of scikit-image
🛠️ Command-Line Usage
bash
Copy
Edit
voxelize [mode] [options] <input> <output.h5>
Option	Default	Description
mode	occ	occ for occupancy grid, sdf for signed distance
--height	32	Grid height (Y axis)
--width	32	Grid width (X axis)
--depth	32	Grid depth (Z axis)
--center	–	Use voxel centers for SDF sampling
--color	–	Retain mesh face colors (occupancy only)

<input> can be a single .off file or a folder of numbered .off files.

🔄 Workflow Example
bash
Copy
Edit
# 1. Scale raw meshes
python examples/scale_off.py examples/raw/ examples/input/ --res 32 --color

# 2. Voxelize
../bin/voxelize sdf ../examples/input ../examples/sdf32.h5

# 3. (Optional) Fill interiors
python examples/fill_occupancy.py occ32.h5 filled.h5

# 4. Convert to .off mesh
python examples/occ_to_off.py filled.h5 mesh_out/ --color examples/input/*_color.h5
